# Learning Javascript_DOM

#Introduction

This repository contains my learning journey as I explore the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. It includes a collection of simple projects that I've built to understand and apply the concepts.

## Deployment

1.Add friend

```bash
https://addd-friend.netlify.app/
```

Implementation of a simple "Add Friend" button, mimicking the functionality found in social media platforms like Facebook.

2.Insta Like Feature

```bash
https://insta-like-btn.netlify.app/
```

Introduces an Instagram-like feature where double-tapping on an image triggers a heart icon to appear, simulating the 'like' action.

3.Custom Cursor

```bash
https://custom-curser.netlify.app/
```

A creative project where a custom cursor in the form of a dot follows the mouse movement, adding a unique and interactive element to the user experience.

4.Hover Animation

```bash
https://hover-image-animation.netlify.app/
```

Demonstrates the use of hover effects in different boxes, triggering the appearance of related images. This project explores the power of CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling.

5.Insta-Story Features

```bash
https://insta-stories-feature.netlify.app/
```

Replication of Instagram story features, showcasing the automatic display of a story for 3 seconds with no transitions to other stories. The story disappears after the designated time, creating a simple and time-bound viewing experience.
