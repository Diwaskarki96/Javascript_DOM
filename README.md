# Learning Javascript_DOM

#Introduction

This repository contains my learning journey as I explore the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. It includes a collection of simple projects that I've built to understand and apply the concepts.

## Deployment

1.Add friend

Implementation of a simple "Add Friend" button, mimicking the functionality found in social media platforms like Facebook.

2.Insta Like Feature

Introduces an Instagram-like feature where double-tapping on an image triggers a heart icon to appear, simulating the 'like' action.

3.Custom Cursor

A creative project where a custom cursor in the form of a dot follows the mouse movement, adding a unique and interactive element to the user experience.

4.Hover Animation

Demonstrates the use of hover effects in different boxes, triggering the appearance of related images. This project explores the power of CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling.

5.Insta-Story Features

Replication of Instagram story features, showcasing the automatic display of a story for 3 seconds with no transitions to other stories. The story disappears after the designated time, creating a simple and time-bound viewing experience.
